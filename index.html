                      <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

We have practiced and given a lot of efforts for the exhibition. When the judges came to our model, they were very happy to see our efforts. They asked many questions related to our model. All the four of us gave the answers with confidence and serenity. At the end of the day when the results were out, we stood second in the competition.</p>

Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry.This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.

                                        2.Economics
                                        Have you ever thought that attendance management system could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to  inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteesm, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                                        <br>
                                        3. Productivity / Efficiency
                                        Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious adminstration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
